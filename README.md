## 💡 About me:

An ex-civil engineer audacious (or crazy) enough to dive into the ocean of data science.

I have a passion for solving complex problems, and along the way I've found that being a data detective is more fun than building concrete structures.

Driven by curiosity, I am always committed to learning the best methods and tools.

I am creative, independent and focused on challenges and innovation.

### ⛰️ Courses and certificates:
I have planned hundreds of hours of courses and projects! Learn more and follow my evolution through my [learning path!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m0wzxjn2hLginp48QwC-GRcaBV54rrhlYhibff-25Wc/edit?usp=sharing)
