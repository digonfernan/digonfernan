## 💡 About me:

A former civil engineer audacious (or crazy) enough to dive into the ocean of data science.

I have a passion for solving complex problems, and along the way I've found that being a data detective is more fun than building concrete structures.

Driven by curiosity, I am always committed to learning the best methods and tools.

I am creative, independent and focused on challenges and innovation.
